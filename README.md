========================


Project Goal
--------------

Build a small React application with an input that takes a postcode, and displays a list of site locations that matches the postcode. Location details include the name of the location and address. Location details should be stored server-side and should be retrieved by a react.


Location json file (storage/app/public/location.json)

```
    [{
        "address": "1 Tony Road",
        "postcode": 2000
    },
    {
        "address": "2 Tony Road",
        "postcode": 2000
    },
    {
        "address": "3 Tony Road",
        "postcode": 2000
    },
    ...
    ....
```
